## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration Priority
1. **Zillow API** - $500-1000/month
   - Most comprehensive data
   - Good documentation
   - Python SDK available

2. **City of Houston Open Data** - Free
   - Permits, crimes, 311 calls
   - REST API available
   - No rate limits

3. **FEMA Flood Maps** - Free
   - Critical for Houston
   - REST API
   - Bulk download available

### ML Model Approach
```python
# Proposed model pipeline
features = [
    'area_sqft', 'area_acres', 'year_built',
    'property_type', 'lat', 'lon',
    'neighborhood_avg_value',  # From enriched data
    'recent_sales_nearby',     # From Zillow
    'crime_score',            # From Houston data
    'flood_zone'              # From FEMA
]

models = {
    'xgboost': XGBRegressor(),
    'random_forest': RandomForestRegressor(),
    'neural_net': MLPRegressor()
}

# Ensemble for better predictions
ensemble = VotingRegressor(models)
```

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Compute**: GPU instances for model training
- **Storage**: +500GB for images and documents  
- **APIs**: Budget $2-3K/month for external data
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for API responses
- **Monitoring**: DataDog or similar

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 (Data Enrichment)
- [ ] 50%+ properties with external data
- [ ] API response time <1s
- [ ] 99% cache hit rate
- [ ] Zero API rate limit hits

### Phase 3 (ML)
- [ ] 80%+ properties with predicted values
- [ ] Model MAE <15% 
- [ ] Prediction latency <100ms
- [ ] 90%+ user trust score

### Phase 6 (Analytics)
- [ ] 1000+ active alerts
- [ ] 50+ portfolio users
- [ ] 10K+ monthly predictions
- [ ] 5-star user ratings

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- API changes/deprecation → Multiple provider strategy
- Model accuracy → Ensemble approach + confidence scores
- Scaling issues → Kubernetes + auto-scaling
- Data quality → Validation pipeline

### Business Risks  
- API costs → Tiered pricing model
- Legal issues → Clear disclaimers + lawyer review
- Competition → Fast execution + unique features
- User adoption → Beta program + feedback loops

## Budget Estimate

### Development Costs
- Phase 2-3: $40-60K (3 developers, 2 months)
- Phase 4-6: $60-80K (4 developers, 3 months)

### Operational Costs (Monthly)
- APIs: $2-3K
- Infrastructure: $1-2K  
- ML Compute: $500-1K
- Total: $3.5-6K/month

### Revenue Potential
- Freemium: 10K users × $0
- Pro: 1K users × $50 = $50K
- Enterprise: 10 × $500 = $5K
- Total: $55K/month at maturity

   - Run Perplexity research prompts
   - Create API comparison spreadsheet
   - Contact API providers for pricing
   - Set up test accounts

2. **Week 2**:
   - Design data aggregation architecture

   - Plan beta user program

3. **Week 3**:
   - Start Zillow API integration
   - Begin ML data preparation
   - Implement basic caching
   - Deploy first enrichment features

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current 3.1% data coverage to a comprehensive property intelligence platform with ML-powered insights and multi-source data enrichment.
