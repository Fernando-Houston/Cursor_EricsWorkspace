## üí° Cost Considerations

### OpenAI Vision API
- ~$0.01-0.03 per image processing
- High accuracy (90-95%)
- Fast processing (2-5 seconds)

### Perplexity API
- ~$0.05-0.10 per enhanced search
- Requires active subscription
- Provides historical data enrichment

## üîí Security & Privacy

- API keys stored securely in environment variables
- No user data stored permanently (unless saved to leads)
- Images processed in real-time, not stored
- HTTPS encryption for all API communications

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to parse body as FormData"**
   - Ensure file is a valid image format
   - Check file size (max 10MB)

2. **"OpenAI API Error"**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check API quota/billing status

3. **"Perplexity Enhancement Failed"**
   - Requires active Perplexity subscription
   - Will fall back to vision-only data

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` to see detailed error messages and API responses.
